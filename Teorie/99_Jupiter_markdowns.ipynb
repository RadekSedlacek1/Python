    "Markdown for Jupyter notebooks cheatsheet\n",
    "Last Updated: 2021-04-08\n",
    "You can use Markdown to format documentation you add to Markdown cells in your Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how to format Markdown cells in Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Headings\n",
    "Use the number sign (#) followed by a blank space for notebook titles and section headings:\n",
    "# for titles\n",
    "## for major headings\n",
    "### for subheadings\n",
    "#### for 4th level subheadings\n",
    "Emphasis\n",
    "Use the following code to emphasize text:\n",
    "Bold text: __string__ or **string**\n",
    "Italic text: _string_ or *string*\n",
    "Mathematical symbols\n",
    "Surround mathematical symbols with a dollar sign ($), for example:\n",
    "$ mathematical symbols $\n",
    "\n",
    "Monospace font\n",
    "Surround text with a grave accent (`) also called a back single quotation mark, for example:\n",
    "`string`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the monospace font for file paths, file names, message text that users see, or text that users enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line breaks\n",
    "Sometimes markdown doesn’t make line breaks when you want them. To force a linebreak, use the following code: <br>\n",
    "Indenting\n",
    "Use the greater than sign (>) followed by a space, for example:\n",
    "> Text that will be indented when the Markdown is rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any subsequent text is indented until the next carriage return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bullets\n",
    "To create a circular bullet point, use one of the following methods. Each bullet point must be on its own line.\n",
    "A hyphen (-) followed by one or two spaces, for example: - Bulleted item\n",
    "A space, a hyphen (-) and a space, for example: - Bulleted item\n",
    "An asterisk (*) followed by one or two spaces, for example: * Bulleted item\n",
    "To create a sub bullet, press Tab before entering the bullet point using one of the methods described above. For example:\n",
    "- Main bullet point\n",
    "     - Sub bullet point\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbered lists\n",
    "To create a numbered list, enter 1. followed by a space, for example:\n",
    "1. Numbered item\n",
    "1. Numbered item\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, you use 1. before each entry. The list will be numbered correctly when you run the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a substep, press Tab before entering the numbered item, for example:\n",
    "1. Numbered item\n",
    "     1. Substep\n",
    "\n",
    "Colored note boxes\n",
    "Use one of the following <div> tags to display text in a colored box.\n",
    "Restriction: Not all Markdown code displays correctly within <div> tags, so review your colored boxes carefully.\n",
    "For example, to make a word bold, surround it with the HTML code for bold (<b>text</b> instead of the Markdown code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The color of the box is determined by the alert type that you specify:\n",
    "Blue boxes (alert-info)\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Tip:</b> Use blue boxes (alert-info) for tips and notes. \n",
    "If it’s a note, you don’t have to include the word “Note”.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Yellow boxes (alert-warning)\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>Example:</b> Use yellow boxes for examples that are not \n",
    "inside code cells, or use for mathematical formulas if needed.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Green boxes (alert-success)\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>Up to you:</b> Use green boxes sparingly, and only for some specific \n",
    "purpose that the other boxes can't cover. For example, if you have a lot \n",
    "of related content to link to, maybe you decide to use green boxes for \n",
    "related links from each section of a notebook.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Red boxes (alert-danger)\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "<b>Just don't:</b> In general, avoid the red boxes. These should only be\n",
    "used for actions that might cause data loss or another major issue.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphics\n",
    "You can attach image files directly to a notebook in Markdown cells by dragging and dropping it into the cell.\n",
    "To add images to other cell types, use graphics that are hosted on the web with this code, substituting url/name with the full URL and name of the image:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=“url/filename.gif” alt=“Alt text” title=“Title text” />\n",
    "\n",
    "Restriction: You cannot add captions to graphics.\n",
    "Geometric shapes\n",
    "Use &# followed by the decimal or hex reference number for the shape, for example:\n",
    "&#reference_number\n",
    "\n",
    "For a list of reference numbers, see UTF-8 Geometric shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal lines\n",
    "On a new line, enter three asterisks:\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal links\n",
    "To link to a section within your notebook, use the following code:\n",
    "[Section title](#section-title)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the text inside the parentheses, replace any spaces and special characters with a hyphen. For example, if your section is called Analyzing customer purchasing habits, you'd enter:\n",
    "[Analyzing customer purchasing habits](#analyzing-customer-purchasing-habits)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can add an ID above the section:\n",
    "<a id=\"section_ID\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: Each ID in the notebook must be unique.\n",
    "To link to a section that has an ID, use the following code:\n",
    "[Section title](#section_ID)\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: Test all internal links to ensure that they work.\n",
    "External links\n",
    "To link to an external site, use the following code:\n",
    "__[link text](http://url)__\n",
    "\n",
    "Surround the link with two underscores (_) on each side\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: Test all links to ensure that they work."
